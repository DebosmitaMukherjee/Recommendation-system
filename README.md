Here is the link to the kaggel data sets for this projects,please download this dataset from there to run the project in your local computer:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
Please download both tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv both

I used cosine similarity approach for this purpose to generate recommendations for your favourite movie.
