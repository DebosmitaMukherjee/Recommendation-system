# Movie Recommendation System
Hello everyone I have created a website to recommend user movies based on their movie choice using content based recommendation engine.
Here is the link for video demo of this project:

Here is the link to the kaggel data sets for this project,please download this dataset from there to run the project in your local computer:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
*Please download both tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv both*

## Requirements
I have used python 3.7 for this project 
I have also used some python libraries- *numpy, pandas,ast, nltk, sklearn, pickle , streamlit , requests*. **Please before running the project , install these libraries.**
Also I have used tmdb api for fetching movie posters from tmdb api , my api kya is used in the file 'app.py' and the api key is : 539d2d5bdfab55d9f5636de376fa0c21, otherwise you can run the app.py file as it is 
I used cosine similarity approach for this purpose to generate recommendations, so there are big files getting used in this project, so if you want to push this project in your repo then use git lfs
